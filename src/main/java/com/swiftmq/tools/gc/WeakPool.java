/**
 * The WeakPool class provides a generic object pooling mechanism using weak references,
 * allowing pooled objects to be garbage-collected when memory is needed. This pool is designed
 * to reduce the overhead of object creation and destruction, particularly for objects that
 * are expensive to create and are used frequently, but should not prevent the JVM from
 * reclaiming memory when the objects are no longer in use.
 * <p>
 * Objects are held in the pool using WeakReferences, which allows the garbage collector to
 * reclaim the objects when there are no strong references to them. When an object is requested,
 * the pool either provides a pooled object or creates a new one if all pooled objects have been
 * reclaimed. When an object is returned to the pool, it is wrapped in a WeakReference and
 * added to the queue.
 * <p>
 * This pool does not guarantee the availability of objects and should be used when object
 * reuse is beneficial but not critical to application logic. It is thread-safe and can be
 * used in concurrent scenarios.
